    <h1>Welcome to "THE HEAVEN" Kauai:</h1>
         <p>Kauai is an island in the Central Pacific, part of the Hawaiian archipelago. It's nicknamed "the Garden Isle" thanks to the tropical rainforest covering much of its surface. The dramatic cliffs and pinnacles of its Na Pali Coast have served as a backdrop for major Hollywood films, while 10-mile-long Waimea Canyon and the Nounou Trails traversing the Sleeping Giant mountain ridge are hiking destinations.</p>

    <h2>Waimea Canyon</h2>
    <p>We hired a car in Kauai and drove to Waimea Canyon. What a surprise. We had heard that is was worth the trip, but was not expecting it to be as stunning. There are lots of activities to do when in the area such as the Canyon Walk and other lookouts which are worthwhile doing.
