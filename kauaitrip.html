                    <p>
                    Kauai is an island in the Central Pacific, part of the Hawaiian archipelago. It's nicknamed "the Garden Isle" thanks to the tropical rainforest covering much of its surface. The dramatic cliffs and pinnacles of its Na Pali Coast have served as a backdrop for major Hollywood films, while 10-mile-long Waimea Canyon and the Nounou Trails traversing the Sleeping Giant mountain ridge are hiking destinations.

                        <p>
                            We hired a car in Kauai and drove to Waimea Canyon. What a surprise. We had heard that is was worth the trip, but was not expecting it to be as stunning. There are lots of activities to do when in the area such as the Canyon Walk and other lookouts which are worthwhile doing. 
                            it was a lovely view of the canyon,it was fully cloudy, we are unable to see a clear view.

                            The torches are lit, the night is filled with music, and family members gather to bring us a casual, relaxing and romantic dining experience that starts off with the Imu Ceremony and thirst-quenching tropical m(c)ocktails are served inside the luau hale. The luau meal features traditional luau favorites, tropical fruit and a special Hawaiian dessert table Hawaiian musicians serenade dinners during the luau meal. Young members of the family take the stage during the entertainment, and even invite guests up on stage for a hula lesson! The International Pageant depicts dances and songs from Tahiti, Hawaii, China, Japan, the Philippines, New Zealand and Samoa.

    Island Beauty:
Kauai is Hawaii’s fourth largest island and is sometimes called the “Garden Isle,” which is an entirely accurate description. The oldest and northernmost island in the Hawaiian chain is draped in emerald valleys, sharp mountain spires and jagged cliffs, aged by time and the elements. Centuries of growth have formed tropical rainforests, forking rivers and cascading waterfalls.
